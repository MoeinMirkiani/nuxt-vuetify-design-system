This repo belongs to [this article](https://medium.com/@moein.mirkiani/nuxt-3-and-vuetify-3-setup-for-a-design-system-a7a7247bd682). In the first part of this article, we create an SSR Nuxt application powered by Vuetify. The second part demonstrates a reliable method to customize Vuetify's components to match the specifications of a design system. A live demo is also available [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nuxt-vuetify-setup?file=nuxt.config.ts).
